excerpt: "Our fifth stop on the Canada road trip was Jasper, a delightful village nestled within the Canadian Rockies. We camped at Whistlers Campground, where we discovered it was the mating season for moose. Initially, the sounds we heard resembled a train moving over tracks, but it soon became clear that it was the calls of nearby moose. These magnificent animals came remarkably close—just a couple of metres away—providing a thrilling and somewhat intimidating experience."

Stop #5 | 22. September - 25. September | [Whistlers Campground](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7U32YXvfR756iYVC6)

## Our experience

Our fifth stop on the Canada road trip was Jasper, a delightful village nestled within the Canadian Rockies. We camped at Whistlers Campground, where we discovered it was the mating season for moose. Initially, the sounds we heard resembled a train moving over tracks, but it soon became clear that it was the calls of nearby moose. These magnificent animals came remarkably close—just a couple of metres away—providing a thrilling and somewhat intimidating experience.

During our stay, we took a tour to Maligne Lake, renowned for its stunning scenery. The journey to the lake was equally rewarding, as we spotted more moose along the way. A highlight of our trip was a gondola ride up to a mountaintop, where we hiked through the snow and absorbed the breathtaking views that surrounded us.

We also ventured along part of the Icefields Parkway, an awe-inspiring road that we nearly had to ourselves, despite the campgrounds being fully booked and overflow parking at capacity. The landscape was absolutely gorgeous, featuring a mix of pine trees and autumn colours set against the backdrop of shimmering turquoise glacier waters, all framed by majestic mountains. Jasper genuinely enriched our road trip experience with its natural beauty and wildlife encounters.
