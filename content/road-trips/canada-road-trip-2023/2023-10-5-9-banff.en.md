## Our experience

This was the last stop in the Rockies, with Calgary as our next destination for departure. Banff presents itself as an interesting and peculiar village. It has a somewhat manufactured feel, designed for tourism, yet still exudes a great deal of charm. We were pleased to discover local transport options from the campground to the village, which we used frequently.

Our explorations included visits to several stunning lakes, where we took in breathtaking views. One of the standout experiences was a via ferrata adventure, which really pushed our adrenaline levels. A particularly unique feature of this climb was a special ladder that required us to face away from the mountain, giving the sensation that we were climbing into the void—an exhilarating and surreal experience.

Another highlight was our visit to the hot springs, an activity we don’t encounter too often. Soaking in the warm waters with the backdrop of towering snowy mountains was nothing short of magical. We felt fortunate to have perfect weather, enhancing our time in this beautiful location.

However, the true highlight emerged from a spontaneous decision to hike after taking the gondola up the mountain. While the majority of visitors remained around the top station, we ventured into the woods, following a path our app suggested. This led us to a serene experience, hiking atop the mountain through knee-high snow and dense pine trees, with spectacular views at every turn. The tranquillity of being alone in nature was a cherished moment, and we found it hard to leave this enchanting place.
