## Our experience

Our eighth stop in Revelstoke was a delightful experience, albeit for just two nights, which felt all too short given how enchanting the village is. The charm of this small town lies in its perfect blend of amenities, from cosy cafes and nice restaurants to beautiful shops, a vibrant farmers market, and lively pubs.

On our first day, we opted for a hike to an old bridge after our original hiking plan was derailed by heavy snowfall. The park ranger had recommended this alternate route, and it did not disappoint. The trail was adorned with trees draped in old man's beard, a slow-growing plant that thrives in pristine air conditions, a testament to the area's clean environment. The fog that enveloped us during the hike created an ethereal ambiance, and by the time we headed back, it had lifted, revealing breathtaking vistas.

Later that evening, we ventured to a local pub. Kathrin generously offered to drive so I could sample some of the local beers. The atmosphere was so enjoyable that we decided to return on our second night. Since we both wanted to indulge in the local brews, we inquired with the campground staff about taxis and were introduced to Howard, reportedly the only taxi driver in Revelstoke. He was a charming character who shared fascinating stories about his journey to the town, adding a unique touch to our evening.

Our visit to the farmers market was another highlight, where we tested our spice tolerance with some impressively hot chillies—thankfully, we survived the experience! Overall, our stay in Revelstoke was truly enjoyable, and we left feeling a little wistful about moving on from this lovely village.
