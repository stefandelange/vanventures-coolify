We did not have high expectations for Vancouver as it was the "arrival destination" i.e. we expected to just deal with jetlag and exploe a little bit, but didn't think this would be an amazing stop already.

It is supposed to be one of the highest ranking cities when it comes to quality of life - we actually had a hard time believing that. Maybe it was the time of year or the jetlag or just once again being overwhelmed by grid-cities. It's a nice place, don't get me wrong, but it just didn't amaze us to that level.

We mostly explored by walking and did some admin things such as getting the access pass for parks and buyng some bear spray.

Most importantly of course we picked up our camper which was a breeze. Initially a little stressed as we had quite an early ferry to catch and no idea how quick the pickup process would be it all turned out to be easy peasy! We got a great introduction to the camper, thew our stuff in the cupboards and went grocery shopping before catching the ferry.
