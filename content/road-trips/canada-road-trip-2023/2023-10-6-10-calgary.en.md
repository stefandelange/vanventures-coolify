## Our experience

Our last stop was Calgary, where we only had one day to check things out. Unfortunately, we left feeling pretty let down. The city's design pushed us toward the long network of skywalks, which helped us get around but kept us mostly inside. This made it hard to really take in the vibe of the city since we missed out on the streets and sights we expected to see.

To make things worse, we had a flight the next day, which reminded us that our road trip was coming to an end. This looming finish overshadowed our time in Calgary, and we couldn’t shake the feeling that we were missing out on more adventures.

Maybe we'll come back. If we have more time to really explore Calgary without the pressure of heading home, we might get a better feel for what the city has to offer. Our first visit wasn’t ideal, but it definitely leaves us wanting to discover more in the future.
