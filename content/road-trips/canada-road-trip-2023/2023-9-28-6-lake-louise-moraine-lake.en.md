## Our experience

Our two-day adventure at Lake Louise and Moraine Lake began with high hopes for serene beauty and untouched wilderness. Upon arrival, the iconic turquoise waters framed by towering peaks were truly breathtaking. However, it quickly became apparent that the lakes were swarmed with visitors, many eager to capture the perfect Instagram shot. This lively atmosphere detracted from the tranquility we were hoping to find.

On day one, we focused on a hike that promised a more secluded experience. We set off toward the old tea hut, a peaceful escape from the bustling shores. The trail meandered through stunning landscapes, lush forests, and rocky outcrops.

Reaching the tea hut, we found a view that made the hike absolutely worth it. Surrounded by fresh mountain air and breathtaking scenery, we paused to soak in how nature can instill a sense of freedom. The tea hut itself was a charming reminder of the region's rich history. We enjoyed our lunches against the stunning backdrop, far removed from the noise and crowds.

Back at the campsite, however, we faced a different reality. The site felt cramped, and the atmosphere fell short of our expectations for a Canadian wilderness experience. The evenings were disrupted by the constant noise of cargo trains passing nearby, their horns echoing in the night. It became clear that the campsite was not conducive to restful sleep.

Ultimately, we decided to cut our stay short by a day, leaving with a mix of emotions.
