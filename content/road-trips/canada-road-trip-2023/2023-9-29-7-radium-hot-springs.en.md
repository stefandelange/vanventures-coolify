Stop #7 | 27. September - 28. September | [RidgeView Resort](https://maps.app.goo.gl/i6PEML9cfiYNDtMYA)

## Our experience

Radium Hot Springs was an unplanned stop and the destination we chose to escape the disappointing campgrounds at Lake Louise. We thought that a day soaking in naturally hot spring water would be relaxing, especially if they came with a view.

So, we really didnt do much as it was a tiny little village. We arrived, we went to the hot springs, we soaked until our skin was about to fall off and we relaxed.

On the road to Radium Hot Springs we spotted a small lake with crystal clear water. It was a bit hard to photograph, but I think we captured the scene quite nicely.
