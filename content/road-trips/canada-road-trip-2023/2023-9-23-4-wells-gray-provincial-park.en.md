## Our experience

We made our way to Wells Gray Provincial Park, setting up base at the peaceful Wells Gray Guest Ranch. Far from cell phone service, the tranquility of the ranch was a great backdrop for our adventures. Our Swiss hosts welcomed us warmly, and each day brought new experiences as they shared their knowledge of the area.

One of the highlights was visiting Bailey's Chute. Standing at the riverbank, we were amazed by the salmon jumping upstream, determined to reach their destination. It felt like a special moment, although nature reminded us of its wild side when we spotted a freshly half-eaten salmon nearby, indicating that bears were in the vicinity. The wilderness was vibrant around us, illustrating the circle of life in such beautiful terrain.

Our time at the ranch included horseback riding through the colorful fall woods, guided by our friendly hosts. Riding through the early morning forest was a memorable experience that ended too quickly.

The highlight of our stop was exploring the park's famous waterfalls. Helmcken Falls, at an impressive 141 meters, took our breath away. We were fortunate to see it at sunset, with a warm glow washing over the falls and lighting up the cliffs. Nature put on a show, rewarding us with a double rainbow above the flowing water – a truly unforgettable moment.
