excerpt: "After Hvide Sande we drove to Rømø a small little island connected by a damn with a street on top. It's also one of Denmark's very famous car beaches. Lots of people go here to chill, surf, wind surd, kite surf, drive kite-drwan carts or just let some kites fly. There is always something cool going on to watch."

After Hvide Sande we drove to Rømø a small little island connected by a damn with a street on top. It's also one of Denmark's very famous car beaches. Lots of people go here to chill, surf, wind surd, kite surf, drive kite-drwan carts or just let some kites fly. There is always something cool going on to watch.

This was the last stop for us, we spent one more night in Denmark and then drove back home.
