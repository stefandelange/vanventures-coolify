On the next day we made our way to Skagen to walk the short trek to the point where the Northern Sea and the Baltic sea meet. It was a lovely little walk along the beach and Skagen itslef is a small little village, but it appears it has a very active and vibrant harbour.

After visiting the city we checked for nice cafés and found one about an hour's drive away.
