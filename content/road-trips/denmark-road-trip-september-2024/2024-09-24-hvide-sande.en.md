Hvide Sande was very important to us as we had heard about omhu:. Omhu: is a local company that turns plastic that gets washed up on the shores into new useful things.

They not only sell recycled plastic, they also clean up the beaches. Every day. And every Wednesday you can take part in a beach clean-up which we did. We were shocked by the amount of plastic that gets washed up and also the types of plastics: q-tips, little stumps from Helium balloons, plastic pallets, plastic rope etc. Whithin a very short time we had over 2kgs collected.
