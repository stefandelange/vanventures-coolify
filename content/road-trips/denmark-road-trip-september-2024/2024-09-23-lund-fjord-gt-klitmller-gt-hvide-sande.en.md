Klitmøller also known as Cold Hawaii is a very small village and we stopped here for a 1 day surf course. We both had never surfed before and didn't have high expectations, however, thanks to the great trainers/coaches/guides we both managed to stand our first wave rather quickly and had a blast afterwards.

Ok, admittedly the waves were very beginner friendly, but it is safe to say that we both got the surf bug!

After our surf adventure we continued to Hvide Sande.
