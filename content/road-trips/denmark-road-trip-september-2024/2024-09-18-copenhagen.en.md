Copenhagen is a beautiful city with lots of interesting and nice architecture. We were especially blown away by the cycling infrastructure. We had heard it's a “bike city”, but we had no idea just how fantastic it is to explore the city by bike. I have probably never felt this safe and respected as a cyclist.

We took it easy and just let ourselves go with the flow…

## Dinner at ARK

[ARK](https://www.restaurantark.dk/eat) is a “green Michelin star” restaurant with a focus on sustainability and it is 100% vegan.

It was probably the best food we ever experienced and the waiters were amazing, too! They were knowledgeable and fun, but also knew when to just let people enjoy their food.

It was mindblowing! We also had the wine selection and that in itself was great.

Here are some impressions of the menu.
