After landing in Rødby by ferry we first drove to Møns Klint. This are is known for its white chalk cliffs and we really wanted to see them first hand.

We also had been driving for quite a few hours at this point without getting much exercise so, a nice walk/hike was very much welcome!

It was well worth the stop, Møns Klint is a breathtaking place - and thus also quite touristy, but it wasn't too bad. We walked down to the beach and followed the sea for a bit until we found another set of stairs that took us back up the hills and eventually back to the parking lot through a forest.

After a couple of hourse we continued on our way to Copenhagen (Kobenhavn). We had a campsite booked in advance as we figured that might be necessary for a city that size and in fact the campsite was quite busy.

Once we were set up it was still early and the weather was fantatstic, so we took public transportation to the city centre and explored a couple of nice areas ending the evening with pizza!

Of course we had to check out Nyhavn - probably the most touristy area in Copenhagen.
