We drove from Copenhagen to Skagen, the northernmost point of Denmark with a short stop at Aarhus. Aarhus has a quaint little core and you notice the life, however, we were not super impressend and quickly continued. We did find the little traffic light-vikings funny!

We stayed at a lovely parking lot in the middle of a forst which was very quiet and gave us a good night's sleep.
