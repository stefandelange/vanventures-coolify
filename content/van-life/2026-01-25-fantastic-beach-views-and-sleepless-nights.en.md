After visiting Reine and the tiny village of Å at the very end of the road, we continued our journey to Vikten – a small and peaceful place known for its glass workshop and its stunning beach.
The light there was absolutely magical. Soft, golden, and constantly changing, it turned the whole landscape into a painting. A group of photographers had gathered to capture the scenery, and we completely understood why. We watched the sun sink slowly into the sea, listened to the sound of the waves, and felt incredibly lucky to be parked right by the water. The area was perfect for long walks along the shore, and we spent two wonderfully relaxed nights there, soaking in the calm and the colours.

From Vikten, we moved on to Napp, a small fishing village where we parked directly at the harbour.

For the weekend, we headed to Lofoten Beach Camp, a place that had been recommended to us and that sits right next to one of the most popular surfing beaches on the islands. The campsite was great, the café was cosy, and the whole place had a laid-back surf vibe. But there was one small detail we underestimated: the weather forecast.

A storm was predicted for the night.
And when it arrived, it arrived properly.

We had already experienced storms in Wales before, but what hit us on the Lofoten was on another level. The wind was so strong that it literally pushed the walls of our van inward. At times, it felt like we might tip over. Sleep was… ambitious. The second night turned out to be even worse. Because we were plugged into shore power, we couldn’t just drive away easily, so we had no choice but to wait it out while the storm kept howling around us.

Completely exhausted, we finally crawled out of the van in the morning and escaped into the café, where at least nothing was shaking. From there, we watched brave surfers heading into the wild waves, wrapped in thick wetsuits and courage. We would have loved to join them, but the conditions were simply too intense for us this time.

Next time, maybe.
