This week was all about spending time with family. We caught up with my mum, aunts, uncles, cousins and my godchild.

First stop: Westende. We played endless rounds of pétanque, embarrassed ourselves at mini golf 🏌️‍♀️ 🤪 and took every opportunity to enjoy cake, coffee and a chat in cosy cafés while soaking up the sun.

Once we had had our fill of the sea breeze, we packed up Wilma and headed for the **Ardennes**. We visited **Dinant**, dramatically squeezed between the river and the cliffs. It's also the birthplace of Adolphe Sax, the genius who gave the world the saxophone.

When in Rome (or Belgium in this case) a stopover at Durbuy - the smallest city in the world - is a must. So, we squeezed Wilma into a tiny parking lot and walked all the little alleys. It probably took us about 7 minutes 38 seconds to see the entire "city" 😉.

However tiny it is, it makes up with its beauty and authenticity and is definitely worth a visit!

We had the privilege of parking our van in front of my cousins holiday home in the Ardennes some 15 mins away from Durbuy. We got to spend a cosy weekend catching up with my cousin and her family, enjoying good food and laughter while the kids zoomed around and we played endless rounds of Hitster and (very professional) ping pong. The best part? The '90s hits! We sang along at the top of our lungs as if no one were listening (the neighbours probably were).

Now, our three-week tour of Belgium is coming to an end and it's time to roll on. Next stop: Berlin. Belgium, you nailed it!
