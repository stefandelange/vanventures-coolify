We spent a few incredible days in Tromsø, often called the "Gateway to the Arctic." It's the largest city in Northern Norway, and back in the 19th century, a French visitor gave it the nickname "Paris of the North." After spending some time here, we can see why – it's lively, stylish, and full of surprises, even this far above the Arctic Circle.

Our first stop was the Arctic Cathedral (Ishavskatedralen), one of Norway's most distinctive and modern churches. With its striking triangular shape inspired by Arctic icebergs, it's impossible to miss.

To experience the city properly, we decided to hike up Storsteinen Mountain. The trail includes more than 1,000 stone steps known as the "Sherpatrappa", which were built by Nepalese Sherpas – a nice touch of Himalayan craftsmanship in the Arctic. The view from the summit was well worth the effort: Tromsø was spread out below us, framed by fjords and peaks.

Back in town, we took it easy and wandered through the streets. Tromsø has the perfect mix of cosy and cool: cafés, outdoor shops and the occasional reindeer souvenir. We couldn't resist buying a Norwegian sweater made of merino wool (because it's supposed to get cold here) and a pair of proper mittens. To warm up, we stopped for coffee and cake – the Norwegian way to fight off the chill! Later that day, we treated ourselves to a veggie burger and a milkshake at a really cool restaurant. Delicious, yes – but also a bit hard on the wallet. Norwegian prices don't mess around!

The real highlight came later in the evening when we booked a session in a floating sauna right in the harbour. Inspired by traditional fish-drying racks, the design was stunning, and the location was perfect – right on the water, surrounded by mountains. After a few rounds in the sauna, it was time for the ultimate challenge: jumping into the Arctic Ocean, which was a brisk 6°C 🥶. It took a bit of mental preparation, but I finally took the plunge! Stefan, on the other hand, decided to be the official photographer of the event. Let's just say one of us earned some extra bragging rights that night! 😏

Just when we thought the day couldn't get any better, Stefan suddenly pointed to the sky on our way back and said, 'It's glowing green!'

Sure enough, there they were: Our first Northern Lights. They were shimmering above the city and dancing gently across the night sky.

It was the perfect end to an unforgettable weekend in Tromsø, a place where the Arctic truly comes alive and where one of us, namely me, has now achieved certified polar bear status. 🐻‍❄️ 😆
