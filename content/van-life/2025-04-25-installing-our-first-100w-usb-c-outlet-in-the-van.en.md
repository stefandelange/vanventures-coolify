When you're living or traveling in a van, power access becomes one of the small luxuries that makes a huge difference. After upgrading our battery setup, the next logical step was to improve how we actually use that power—starting with a high-speed USB-C outlet.

We went for a 100W Power Delivery (PD) USB-C outlet, and now that it's in, we can't imagine life without it.

## Why We Wanted One

Laptops, phones, cameras, headlamps, headphones—everything runs on USB-C these days. Sure, you can use adapters and wall chargers, but we wanted a dedicated, flush-mounted USB-C outlet that could deliver serious power, fast.

This wasn't about just adding another charger—it was about making our van more self-contained, easier to live in, and more efficient. With our 540Ah lithium battery and solar panels feeding it, we wanted to plug in directly and take advantage of all that energy we've worked hard to harvest.

## What We Used

We picked up a Tigerexped 100W USB-C PD outlet. It's compact, solidly built, and shows the voltage level with a ring-style indicator. It supports 5V, 9V, 12V, 15V, and 20V output, depending on the device.

This meant we could charge things like:

- MacBooks and tablets
- Phones and portable batteries
- Drone batteries via USB-C
- USB-powered fans or other accessories

And all without needing an inverter or AC plug.

## How We Installed It

The process was pretty straightforward, though it required some careful drilling and neat wiring.

1. We drilled a clean round hole in the plastic seat panel near our power hub.
2. The outlet was wired into our existing power system, directly to the 12V distribution behind the seat.
3. We used crimp connectors and a fuse to make sure everything was solid and safe.
4. Once wired up, the panel was closed again, and the outlet sat flush for a clean, integrated look.

Everything came together nicely, and we were able to test charging speeds right away. The outlet negotiated the voltage automatically and ramped up to full speed with a USB-C laptop and phone.

## A Small Upgrade With a Big Impact

It might seem like a small thing, but having high-speed charging right where we need it—without dongles or converters—is a game changer. It simplifies our day-to-day in the van and makes better use of our off-grid power setup.

Whether we're working remotely, recharging camera gear after a hike, or just keeping our phones topped up, this outlet is now part of our daily rhythm.

If you're building out a van or just looking to improve your setup, we highly recommend adding one of these. It's a quick win with long-term payoff.

**Stay powered up!**
