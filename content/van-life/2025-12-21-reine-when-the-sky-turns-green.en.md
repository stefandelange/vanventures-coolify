excerpt: "If you've ever wondered whether places from postcards actually exist, let me introduce you to Reine. Nestled among dramatic granite peaks, dotted with bright red fishermen's cabins, and surrounded by impossibly turquoise water, Reine is the kind of place that makes you stop mid-sentence and simply stare. It's often called one of the most beautiful villages in the world — and honestly, we get it."

If you've ever wondered whether places from postcards actually exist, let me introduce you to Reine. Nestled among dramatic granite peaks, dotted with bright red fishermen's cabins, and surrounded by impossibly turquoise water, Reine is the kind of place that makes you stop mid-sentence and simply stare. It's often called one of the most beautiful villages in the world — and honestly, we get it.

Reine has been inhabited for more than a thousand years and has long been an important fishing village. Today, it's one of the Lofoten's most iconic destinations, attracting nature lovers, photographers, and anyone chasing that feeling of standing somewhere truly extraordinary.

And of course… you can't visit Reine without hiking Reinebringen, the mountain that has become the viewpoint of the entire archipelago.

Reinebringen: 1,978 Steps to Pure Magic

The trail up Reinebringen is famous — partly because of the views, partly because of the effort it takes to reach them. The 1,978 stone steps, carefully built by Nepalese Sherpas, wind steeply up the mountain like a staircase to the sky.

Most people take 1.5 to 2 of hours to reach the top.
We powered through in 45 minutes 😃. The climb was steep, but every time we paused to catch our breath, the view behind us looked increasingly unreal.

When we finally reached the summit, we quickly realised we weren't alone.
Dozens of hikers were already up there, all trying to capture the perfect shot of themselves with the view — and honestly, who could blame them? With a backdrop like that, even we couldn't resist taking a few "just one more" photos.

It felt like stepping into a living postcard.
Imagine the Lofoten you know from photos — then multiply that by ten.

The weather that day was perfect. So, a few hours later, we made a spontaneous decision:

Let's climb it again.

Back up the nearly 2,000 steps, this time in the dark, equipped with headlamps, blankets, and a sense of adventure that was probably 20% enthusiasm and 80% questionable judgment.

When we reached the top a second time, something incredible happened.
A soft green shimmer appeared above the mountains… then grew brighter… then began to dance.

The Northern Lights.
It felt as if they were there just for us.
No crowd. No noise.

We stood there for more than three hours, wrapped in blankets, our faces frozen, our hearts completely full. Watching the aurora ripple across the sky from the top of Reinebringen felt like stepping into a dream we didn't even know we had.

Descending those 1,978 steps in the dark afterwards?
Let's just say: carefully. Very carefully.
And yes — the muscle soreness the next day was real.

Reine is more than beautiful, it's unforgettable. A village where ancient fishing history meets wild landscapes.

And sometimes, if you're lucky, the sky answers back in green.

Reine didn't just amaze us, it wrapped us in magic. And it's a place we'll carry with us for a very long time.

The next day we drove on to Å, the tiny village at the end of the road. There, we treated ourselves to what might have been the best cinnamon buns of our entire trip, fresh from an old bakery that's been around for generations. _yummy_ 🤤
