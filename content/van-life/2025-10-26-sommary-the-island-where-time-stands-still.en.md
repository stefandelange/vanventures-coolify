After spending a few days in Tromsø, we travelled to Sommarøy, a tiny fishing village which literally means 'Summer Island' in Norwegian. This tiny fishing village is located about an hour west of Tromsø and is home to around 350 people and more seagulls than inhabitants. It boasts some of the most beautiful beaches in Northern Norway.

We parked Wilma at a private campsite right by the sea. It was surrounded by crystal-clear water and white sand. It was beautiful to look at, and the weather was teasing us to go for a swim - but the water temperature isn't "pleasant" 🥶

To stretch our legs, we went for a hike up one of the nearby hills and were rewarded with an incredible panoramic view of Sommarøy and its cluster of tiny islands, which are connected by bridges and causeways. From up there, the colourful houses looked as though they were scattered across a postcard – red, blue and yellow, each one brighter than the last.

After the hike, we followed the irresistible smell of freshly baked waffles drifting through the air. This led us straight to a tiny knitting shop run by a group of elderly ladies who served us warm Norwegian waffles with jam. They were pure heaven – and a nice vegetarian treat in a country where fish and meat tend to dominate the menu. Norwegians certainly know how to make waffles: soft, buttery and just sweet enough.

As the sun slowly sank towards the horizon, the sky changed colour by the second, from soft pink to glowing orange to deep purple. Every moment felt like a painting coming to life. We sat by the water, completely enchanted. Without question, it was the best sunset of our trip so far – no music, no plans, just nature putting on her own show.

Sommarøy is sometimes known as "the island where time doesn't exist". In 2019, the locals started a campaign to abolish time altogether, arguing that, during the summer months when the sun never sets, clocks are pretty pointless anyway.

Whether or not the campaign was serious, the idea captured the spirit of the island perfectly: slow down, enjoy the light and forget what time it is. 🧡
