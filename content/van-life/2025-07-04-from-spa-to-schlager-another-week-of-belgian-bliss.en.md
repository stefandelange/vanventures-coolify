What a week! The weather was chef's kiss, and we took full advantage of it. We explored the beautiful "Polders" on foot from our idyllic camping spot near Oudenburg.

In between strolls, I got to indulge in one of my favourite hobbies: painting. I made a little thank-you card for the lovely owner of the magical meadow where we were allowed to stay for over a week – for free! (Yes, free. Yes, in Belgium. We're still not over it.)

One day, we hopped on our bikes and rode to De Haan, where we took a long walk along the beach. Sunshine, sand and just the right amount of windblown hair!

Later that afternoon, things got fancy: we visited Spa Sileau, a wellness oasis near Oudenburg. The best part? We had the entire place to ourselves. We enjoyed the sauna, steam room and hot tub with a golden sunset as our backdrop. If that's not luxury van life, we don't know what is!

After 10 glorious days, we finally left our beloved meadow and rolled into Middelkerke, where Wilma suddenly found herself surrounded by identical campers. It was a bit like parking in a mobile suburb. But hey, the campsite was right by the sea, and the real gem was waiting for us that night:

'Bier aan Zee' – a Belgian beer festival on the promenade that was open until midnight.

There were booths upon booths of local brews, multiple stages and DJs and yes, Belgian Schlager too. Some of the music was great, some questionable, but all loud. With a cold beer in hand, we took everything in our stride: we danced on the promenade and laughed at the chaos. It was the perfect way to end a great, sunny week.
