We visited the Vesterålen Islands, a tranquil archipelago located just north of the Lofoten Islands. We arrived by ferry in Andenes, the northernmost town in the archipelago. The town is best known for whale watching, as the deep waters off the coast are home to sperm whales all year round.

We've been lucky enough to see these incredible creatures before — in [Tofino (Canada)](https://vanventures.blog/en/canada-road-trip-2023/2023-9-17-2-vancouver-island) and Kaikōura (New Zealand) — so this time, we decided not to join one of the crowded whale-watching boats and instead spent the day enjoying the peace and quiet of the coastline. Just us, the sea, and a butterfly. 🦋

A short drive from Andenes took us to Bleik, a small coastal village boasting a long white sandy beach and of course turquoise water. Just offshore lies Bleiksøya, a tiny island famous for its large puffin colony that nests there during the summer months. We would have loved to take a boat trip to see this little funny birds up close, but unfortunately the season had already ended and the tours had stopped running.

While walking along the beach, something unexpected happened: a butterfly followed me for quite a while, fluttering right beside me as if it didn't want to leave. Perhaps it was attracted to my bright jacket, or maybe it just liked the company 😍.

The weather was so good that we decided to go on another hike, this time up Måtind — one of the most popular peaks on Andøya island. And with good reason: at just 408 metres, the summit offers a truly breathtaking view. From the top, you can see the rugged coastline stretching endlessly into the distance, the deep blue sea below and the secluded bay of Høyvika.

The trail is steep in places and includes some light scrambling, but every step is worth it. Standing on the summit, with the wind in our faces and the ocean below, we felt as though we were standing on the edge of the world.

On our way south, we stopped in Stokmarknes, which is home to the Hurtigruten Museum. It was here that the famous Norwegian coastal express began its journey in 1893, connecting northern and southern Norway and facilitating travel and trade along the rugged coast. The museum's highlight is the MS Finnmarken, a 1956 Hurtigruten ship that has been preserved inside a large glass building. Walking through the old cabins and dining rooms provides a fascinating insight into life on board decades ago.

What we liked most about Vesterålen is how genuine it feels. The landscapes are wild and untouched, that's what we love.
