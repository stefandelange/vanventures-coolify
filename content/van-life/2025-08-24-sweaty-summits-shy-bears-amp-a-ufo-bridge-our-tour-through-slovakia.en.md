After spending a few relaxing days at the B&B run by Martha and Michał near Krakow, our lovely hosts suggested to visit the Tatra Mountains in Slovakia.

"If you like mountains and hiking, you should visit the Tatra Mountains in Slovakia."

Mountains? Hiking? A chance to stretch our legs after eating far too many pierogi? Absolutely!

So off we went and soon found ourselves parked in a beautiful spot in the heart of the Tatras, surrounded by towering peaks and a small, crystal-clear river.

Stefan chose our first hiking trail.
"It's medium difficulty", he said casually.
What he didn't mention? The elevation gain: about 900m uphill, just always uphill.

After a few hours of huffing and puffing, we reached the summit – happy, sweaty and in awe of the view. The view? Absolutely worth it! The best part? We had the whole summit to ourselves. Not a soul in sight, except for a few curious birds. The Tatras are home to plenty of bears, but luckily they decided to steer clear of our route!

We later learned that the Tatras are called the "Mini Alps" for a reason. They may be smaller, but they certainly deliver when it comes to stunning views.

Slovakia itself won us over in no time. The scenery was breathtaking, the people were incredibly warm and welcoming, and finding beautiful wild camping spots was surprisingly easy. Well, except near Bratislava. That is a different story.

With their peaks, rivers and peaceful trails, the Tatra Mountains gave us exactly what we needed: fresh air, sore legs and a reminder of how small we are compared to nature. Next time, though, Stefan might have to share the full trail details before we start climbing... just saying!
