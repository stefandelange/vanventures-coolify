After exploring city after city, we felt the pull of nature again, not to mention the itch to finally try out our SUP board.

Our first stop was Gmunden, a picture-perfect town on the shores of Lake Traun. On Sunday, we spent the whole day out on the water, paddling with the mountains as our backdrop. Did you know that Traunsee is Austria’s deepest lake at over 190 metres? 

In the evening, we bought a pizza, sat down on the lakeshore and watched the sun set over the water, it's the simple moments that really are the best.

We loved the SUP life so much that we took our board out again at the Attersee, which is famous for its turquoise-blue water. It’s actually the largest lake entirely within Austria, and the water is so clean that it’s used as drinking water for the surrounding region. With Wilma parked right by the shore, we turned our lunch break into a swim break. Nothing says 'remote work goals' quite like closing your laptop, diving straight into crystal-clear water and calling it the best lunch break ever.

As well as being nature lovers, we're also die-hard campers (otherwise we wouldn't be living like this 😉), so we couldn't pass up the chance to visit the Hymer Museum. It's not just a showroom, it's a journey through the history of motorhomes, with over 80 classic vehicles on display. From quirky 1950s models to futuristic concepts, it shows how van life has evolved over the decades.

After a few days of lakes and camper nostalgia, we were reminded of why we love this lifestyle so much!
