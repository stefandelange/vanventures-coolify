excerpt: "After 13 hours on the road, we finally arrived in Berlin, exhausted and starving, just dreaming of a quiet spot to park Wilma and relax. However, reality had other ideas: our booked 'campsite' was essentially a glorified car park at a busy junction, right next to a petrol station. It was not exactly the peaceful green haven we had imagined. It wasn't cheap either. \n But never mind, on the plus side, the bathrooms were spotless and the owner was really friendly. Sometimes you just have to take the wins where you can find them."

After 13 hours on the road, we finally arrived in Berlin, exhausted and starving, just dreaming of a quiet spot to park Wilma and relax. However, reality had other ideas: our booked 'campsite' was essentially a glorified car park at a busy junction, right next to a petrol station. It was not exactly the peaceful green haven we had imagined. It wasn't cheap either.

But never mind, on the plus side, the bathrooms were spotless and the owner was really friendly. Sometimes you just have to take the wins where you can find them.

The real challenge? The relentless heat, coupled with the fact that we were both trying to work inside the van, which had essentially turned into a tiny, rolling sauna with Wi-Fi.

Needless to say, productivity was low and sweat levels were off the charts. But perhaps that's why we appreciated our evenings even more: shutting the laptops, escaping the sauna on wheels and catching up with our friends was the best reward. 🩷
