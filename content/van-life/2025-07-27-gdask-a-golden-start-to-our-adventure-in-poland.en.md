Our Polish road trip kicked off in the best way possible: with the beautiful city of Gdańsk. We didn't really know what to expect.

We found the perfect spot for Wilma, right by the harbour and just a stone's throw from the historic city centre. Finding a level (ish) spot proved a bit of a challenge, but we were lucky as a fellow German camper-couple was just leaving.

Gdańsk greeted us with its historic beauty and streets shimmering with amber treasures, and we were immediately captivated. As we wandered through the charming streets, we passed countless little stalls and shops selling all things golden and glowy. Necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and mysterious hunks of fossilised tree resin. Amber is absolutely everywhere here!

We couldn't resist climbing to the top of the massive St. Mary's Church, which is one of the largest brick churches in the world. A proper leg workout, yes, but the view over Gdańsk's red rooftops and winding alleys was absolutely worth every single step – of the total 405.

The old town itself is straight-up fairy tale material: pastel-coloured buildings, cobblestone streets and a constant, gentle buzz of people eating, chatting, wandering. The fact that most of it was rebuilt after WWII makes it all the more impressive. Being used to fast purpose focused concrete rebuilding efforts like Cologne for instance, Gdańsk proved it can be done differently and more beautifully.

And then came the food... In the evening, we sat down and ordered what any respectable traveler must try in Poland: Pierogi.

It's soft, doughy and absolutely crammed with magic! Okay, it was technically cabbage and spinach, but let's not get stuck on that. They were so delicious that we were tempted to order another round straight away! (We definitely should have!)

The next day, we kicked things off with breakfast in one of the many cute cafés scattered around the city, and then visited the Museum of the Second World War. It was moving, powerful, and exceptionnaly well done. A must-visit that left us quiet and thoughtful for the rest of the afternoon.

Gdańsk was the perfect start to our time in Poland – full of history, beauty and delicious food.

Fueled by the delicious pierogi, we set off for the Masurian Lakes, choosing a spot near Olsztyn. The weather was still sunny – for now – and our chosen lake was packed with people having a great time.

So, we improvised: we found a quieter lake, tucked into the forest. Peace at last. Until we checked the weather app.

Seven days of nonstop rain.

A heartbreaking forecast.

Eventually, with heavy hearts, we waved goodbye to Masuria before we'd really said hello and set off towards the city of Warsaw.
