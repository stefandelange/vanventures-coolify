We cannot imagine people behaving this way in their own backyard - so why on earth would you behave like this in public? Campers are destroying their own way of life and we can understand why locals get fed up even in countries where wild camping is tolerated/accepted.",

While I love the buzz and excitement of cities, I'm definitely a country soul at heart. There's nothing like the feeling of being surrounded by nature. Whether I'm hiking through forests, cycling along winding trails, surfing the waves, or climbing to new heights, I'm happiest when I'm outdoors, breathing in the fresh air and pushing my limits.",

Locals, however, told us that just weeks before the areas where clouded by thick smoke and we could see huge areas of burned down trees.",

Initially we wanted to remain as flexible as possible, but in key locations we waned to make sure we would definitely be able to visit. As a consequence we pre-booked the entire route. In the end it was more important to us to experience the locations rather than remain fully flexible. Ultimately, we could still depart a location early and switch if we didn't like it (spoiler: and we did, because holy {swearword} those Canadian cargo trains honk their horns all night and at some campsites you sleep right next to the tracks!).",

Even better: you can fill them at any time, you don't have to wait for a bottle to be completely empty (like you would if you had to exchange it). That means when you come by a station with LPG/Autogas, just top up your bottle and you are pretty much never running out of gas again.",

Since we are close (ish) to Cologne, we had our installation done by Ralf Kohl from <link>https://www.wohnmobil-elektronik.de/</link>. The service and consultation was great and the installation only took a couple of hours. Ralf also gave us a thoroguh introduction and step-by-step instructions how to use the system safely.",
